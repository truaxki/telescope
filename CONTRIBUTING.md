1. Add focus mode to `telescope-prompts/focus-modes/`
2. Define which agents activate and emphasis areas
3. Update README focus modes table
4. Test on real codebase

### 2. Agent Specializations
Create new agent types for domain-specific analysis.

**Steps:**
1. Add agent template to `telescope-prompts/agents/`
2. Define expertise area and output requirements
3. Update orchestration configuration
4. Test and document

### 3. Template Improvements
Enhance existing prompts for better analysis quality.

**Focus areas:**
- More specific requirements
- Better output structure
- Additional examples
- Clearer success criteria

### 4. Bug Reports
Report issues with detailed reproduction steps.

**Include:**
- Command used

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Be Specific
```markdown
# Bad:
"Analyze the code"

# Good:
"Analyze ADK agent hierarchies:
1. Map agent relationships (visual)
2. Document state keys (type, structure)
3. Identify callback patterns
4. Assess vs best practices"
```

### Provide Structure
Include required sections, output format, success criteria, and examples.

### Include Context
Give agents their specialization, focus files/directories, analysis depth, and coordination with other agents.

### Define Success
```markdown
Analysis complete when:
âœ… All assigned files reviewed
âœ… Pain points identified with severity
âœ… Recommendations prioritized
âœ… Examples provided
```

### Show Examples
Include example outputs for pain points, recommendations, and findings.
