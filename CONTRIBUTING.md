## üé® Prompt Engineering Best Practices

When contributing new prompts or improving existing ones:

### 1. Be Specific
```markdown
# Bad:
"Analyze the code"

# Good:
"Analyze ADK agent hierarchies:
1. Map agent relationships (visual diagram)
2. Document session state keys (type, structure, usage)
3. Identify callback patterns (before/after agent/tool/model)
4. Assess against ADK best practices"
```

### 2. Provide Structure
```markdown
# Include:
- Required sections (numbered list)
- Output format (markdown, location, naming)
- Success criteria (what makes it complete)
- Examples (show expected output format)
```

### 3. Include Context
```markdown
# Give agent context:
- What specialization they have
- What files/directories to focus on
- What depth of analysis required
- What other agents are doing (avoid overlap)
```

### 4. Define Success
```markdown
# Clear completion criteria:
- "Analysis complete when:"
  ‚úÖ All assigned files reviewed
  ‚úÖ Pain points identified with severity
  ‚úÖ Recommendations prioritized
  ‚úÖ Examples provided for key findings
```

### 5. Show Examples
```markdown
# Include example output:
"Example Pain Point:
‚ùå Pain Point 1: Missing State Documentation
- Problem: [specific issue]
- Location: [file:line]
- Impact: [effect on system]
- Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- Recommendation: [how to fix]"
```
