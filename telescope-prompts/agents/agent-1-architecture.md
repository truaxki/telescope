```
ComponentA
├── depends on → ComponentB
│   ├── depends on → ComponentD
│   └── depends on → ComponentE
└── depends on → ComponentC
    └── depends on → ComponentD
```

### 3. Design Pattern Catalog
List all design patterns identified:
```yaml
patterns:
  factory_pattern:
    locations:
      - "src/factories/UserFactory.js"
      - "src/factories/OrderFactory.js"
    purpose: "Object creation with complex initialization"
    effectiveness: "High - reduces duplication"

  repository_pattern:
    locations:
      - "src/repositories/UserRepository.js"
      - "src/repositories/OrderRepository.js"
    purpose: "Data access abstraction"
